## ðŸ”¹ Repository Overview

The repository includes the following projects:

- **Bank Management System (C#)**: Simulates basic banking operations, account management, and transaction handling.
- **Global Transportation Management System (C#)**: Demonstrates object-oriented design in managing transportation logistics.
- **Library Management (C# / Python)**: Implements functionalities for tracking books, users, and loans.
- **Hotel Reservation Management (C#)**: A simple OOP-based hotel booking and room management system.
- **Sales Management System (Python)**: Console-based system for managing sales and inventory using OOP principles.

Each project emphasizes clean design, modularity, and the use of OOP best practices.

## ðŸ”¹ Usage

Each project is self-contained. To run a project:

1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Open the project in the relevant IDE:
   - **C# projects**: Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with C# extension.
   - **Python projects**: Python 3.6+ installed on your system.
3. Follow instructions in individual project README files (if available) to run the application.

Example for Python projects:

```bash
cd Sales_Management_System
python main.py
```
